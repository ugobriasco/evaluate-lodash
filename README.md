# Evaluate Lodash library

This project aims to benchmark lodash performance, compared to native implementation.

## Getting started

```
npm i
npm start
```

The test results (including plots) will be available under `./data`.

Following a list of methods under test:

- \_.find
- \_.reduce

## Configuration

#### Lodash version

The default Loadash version under test is _4.17.21_. In order to select a different one, upodate `./package.json`, then:

```
    rm -rf node_modules
    npm i
```

#### Test intensity

Change `./lib/settings.js` to modify the test intensity (e.g. increasing the dataset or increase repetitions)
